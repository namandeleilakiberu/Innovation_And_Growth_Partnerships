# Partnership for Goals

A simple website that brings people, businesses, and organizations together to support sustainable development and community growth.

This project contains three main pages:

- `index.html` — Home page with a short mission and features.
- `about.html` — Explains the project's vision and values.
- `contact.html` — A contact form (uses Formspree) and other ways to reach you.

Other files:

- `style.css` — All the site styles.
- `logo.png` — Site logo used in the header.
- `script.js` — Small JavaScript for the year in the footer and menu toggle.


Quick start (view locally)

1. Open the project folder.
2. The easiest way is to open `index.html` in your browser.



Notes about fonts and offline use

- The site uses Google Fonts (loaded from the web). When you are offline the browser will use system fonts and the look may change.
